    // PS: Best way to write marketplace would be to use e.g. Rx.js and think of

    // and cancellations (that come from a UI, DOM events, message queue or
    // whatever) and turns it into an asynchronous sequence of snapshots (that
    // we can then pipe back into a UI or wherever we want).
    // That is the amazing beauty of reactive programming
    // (and the React/Redux/Cycle.js etc. architecture) - it allows us to
    // solve problems that allegedly require mutable state (user interfaces!)
    // with purely functional (stateless, pure) means - bliss!
